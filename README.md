# Cap Courier

## About

Welcome to the Cap Courier, a personal project meant to help me organize my bottlecap collection. When I started this project, I had over 1000 unique caps, which meant that I knew when I inevitably didn't finish the app, I would have pick it up again later instead of starting over.

## Getting Started
